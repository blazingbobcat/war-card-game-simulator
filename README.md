### STATISTICAL SIMULATION OF WAR CARD GAME

The game of War is the longest game played with a 52-card deck.  Played between two players, the object is to win all the cards in a series 
of tricks.  The game practically plays itself since the players have no control over the cards in their decks.  

The rules are as follows:  both players are given 26-card decks, and then must place one card at a time down, face up.  The values of both
cards are compared, the player with the higher value card wins the trick.  If the values are the same, each player must put down a card
face down and then another face up, then compare the values.  This goes on until one card's value is higher than the other's, in which case
the player who presented the higher value wins all the cards.  Some variations of the game have players put down multiple cards face down 
and one face up to compare values before a player wins the trick.  Play continues until one player wins all 52 cards.

There is no way to tell for how long a game of War will last, though it could go on for hours.  This simulator will create two virtual
players, each with 26 playing cards and play through the game of War, recording the time.  First, the user inputs the number of games of
War to play in succession.  After all the games are played, however long it takes, all the times playing are recorded and then averaged.
The purpose is to find the average time playing War.  After the simulation is over, the total time, average time the games are played, and
the number of wins per player are output.  The user may choose to start a new simulation then, and the whole process is repeated.  It can
not be stressed enough to have patience; a simulation may take a long time to complete, depending on the user's machine.  If the user sees nothing but "Playing xx games..." after inputting the number of games, they must understand the program is running at maximum speed.  Especially with
more than one game input, the simulator will need to take its time towards completion.  If this program is run for scientific or academic
purposes, the user needs to copy down the output, as it is not recorded in an external file.  

Or, you could play the game with a friend multiple times yourself with a stopwatch, and record all the times. XD
